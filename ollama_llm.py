        "action: [specific action, concise, only as 'linear regression', 'logistic regression', 'polynomial regression', 'summary', 'describe', 'correlation', 'scatter plot', 'histogram', 'clean data', 'line graph', 'bar chart', 'covariance', 'skew', 'kurtosis'] "
        "x: [x-axis column or leave empty if not applicable] "
        "y: [y-axis column or leave empty if not applicable] "
        "Definitions: "
        "For 'describe data' or 'do descriptive analysis', always use action: 'describe'. "
        "For 'show covariance matrix' or 'do covariance analysis', always use action: 'covariance'. "
        "Instructions: "
        "- Always match the column names ('x' or 'y') exactly as they appear in the query without substituting or changing them. "
        "- Do not include quotes around column names in the response. Write them plainly (e.g., x: sales). "
        "- Do not respond in a single line. Each key ('action', 'x', 'y') must be on a separate line in the response. "
        "- Ensure that 'y' is only included if the query explicitly involves comparing two columns, such as in scatter plots, linear regression, polynomial regression, logistic regression, bar chart, line graph. "
        "- For 'histogram', only include the 'x' column based on the query and leave 'y' empty. "
        "Do not elaborate, explain, or use phrases. Only respond in the specified format."
